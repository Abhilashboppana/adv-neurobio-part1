Anatomical terminology of orientation
(1) Superior and Inferior
According to the anatomical position, cranium is superior and feet is inferior.
(2) Anterior and Posterior
Rostral is anterior and Caudal is posterior.
(3) Ventralis and Dorsalis
(4) Medialis and Lateralis
According to median line, proximal part is medialis and distal part is lateralis.
(5) Interior and Exterior
To describe relative spatial relationships of specific structures and cavities.
Note: They are different from medialis and lateralis.
(6) Superficial and Deep
According to body surface, proximal part is superficial and distal part is deep.

Central Nervous System (CNS)
-- Composed of brain, spinal cord and spinal nerves

Brain
- Telencephalon (outer bigger part including cortex)
- Diencephalon (the middle part)
- Cerebellum (present behind brain stem i.e. behind bottom of brain)
- Brain Stem (provides the continuity towards the spinal cord)

Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)
- BBB is highly selective permeability barrier that separates circulating blood from brain extracellular fluid in CNS.
- It is formed by capillary endothelial cells which are connected by tight junctions.
- It allows passage of water, some gases and lipid soluble molecules by passive diffusion as well as selective transport of molecules such as,
glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function.
- It may prevent the entry of lipophilic, potential neurotoxins by active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein.
- Astrocytes are necessary to create the BBB.
- BBB occurs along all capillaries and consists of tight junctions around capillaries that don't exist in normal circulation.
- Endothelial cells restrict the diffusion of microscopic objects (e.g. bacteria) and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) while allowing the diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules (O2, CO2, hormones).
- Cells of the barrier actively transport metabolic products such as glucose across the barrier with specific proteins.
